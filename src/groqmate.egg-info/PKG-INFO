# Groqmate

An interactive CLI learning coach powered by Groq. Think of it as a gym coach for your brain — it spots you, challenges you, and waits for you to lift the weight.

## What makes it different?

| ChatGPT | Groqmate |
|---------|----------|
| Professor delivering a lecture | Pair programmer / gym coach |
| Passive consumption | Active learning |
| Wall of text | Atomic, bite-sized chunks |
| No friction | Quiz locks between concepts |

## Features

- **Hidden Curriculum:** AI generates a 5-step plan before teaching — you see progress, not a lecture.
- **Quiz Lock:** Must answer correctly to unlock the next concept.
- **`wtf` Command:** Stuck? Type `wtf` and get a fresh analogy.
- **Flashcard Mode:** Session ends with a `notes.md` summary.
- **Terminal-native:** ASCII graphs, Unicode math, no heavy browser UI.
- **Streaming:** Token-by-token responses for a real-time feel.

## Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Textual** — Rich TUI framework
- **Groq API** — LLM backend (instant speed)
- **Pydantic** — Data validation
